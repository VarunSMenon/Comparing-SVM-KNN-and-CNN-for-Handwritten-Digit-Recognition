# Comparing SVM, KNN and CNN for Handwritten Digit Recognition  

This project analyzes and compares the performance of three machine learning models — Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) — on the task of recognizing handwritten digits (like from the MNIST dataset). It highlights their accuracy, speed, and suitability for image classification.
